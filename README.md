# YellowTripQueries

A Thanksgiving weekend project to test drive DuckDB & VegaLite on a toy project 
with real data (medium sized data). Objective is to understand how well DuckDB works for
larger than memory analysis on my 10 Core M1 Mac. 

## Dataset

I have used [NYC Yellow Taxi](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page) 
trip record dataset for the years 2011 - 2021 (11 Years). This amounts to ~17GB of compressed
parquet files with approximately 1.3 Billion individual records.
